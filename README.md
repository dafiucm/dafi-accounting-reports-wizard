# DAFI Accounting Reports Wizard

## Introduction

This tool's purpose is to automatically process the cumulative expense PDF reports generated by the UCM accounting system and provided by the Economic Affairs Office of the University, which cannot be exported to Excel or CSV.

## How to use

Create a `.tmp` folder and place the cumulative expense PDF report file in it. Then run the script `main.py` with Python 3.6. The script will generate a XLSX file with the processed data in the same `.tmp` folder.
